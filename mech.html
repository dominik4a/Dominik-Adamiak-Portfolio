        <h2>APS112 Stimulus Response-Conditioning Project</h2>
        <p>This is the final project presented on a stimulus-response
            conditioning device for the purposes of bedsore relief in a 6-year old non-ambulatory 
            patient. This is the 2nd design project class in the mechanical engineering curriculum 
            at the University of Toronto, and as such the focus of the report and presentation is to 
            apply the engineering design process to a predefined problem posed by real-world clients.

        <h2>MIE243 CNC Machine Project</h2>
        <p>This is the final project in MIE243: Mechanical Engineering Design, detailing the design of a desktop CNC
            machine. This is the first design project involving the use of SolidWorks CAD in the MIE curriculum. This project 
            includes a full appendix of engineering drawings detailing the design.

        <h2>MIE243 Gearbox Assembly Project</h2>
        <p>This is an interm project in MIE243: Mechanical Engineering Design, which involved the 
            design, construction and testing of a small gearbox in SolidWorks, printed using the 3D
            Dremal printing system.

        <h2>MIE301 Planar Delta Mechanism Project</h2>
        <p>This is the final project in MIE301: Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines. A conceptual design for a planar delta 
            mechanism is proposed, followed by a full kinematic and dynamic analysis using MIE301 course concepts such as 
            vectors loops, dynamic force analysis, forward/inverse kinematics etc. with a MATLAB implementation.
